Just a tiny example on how to download a movie stored in a twitter thread.

Install what's needed from `requirements.txt` and check `twitter_thread_film.py` on instructions
and parameters to modify; you will need an API key from Twitter.

After the file has been modified accordingly just run `twitter_thread_film.py`

Credit where is due, I took some code to find the tweets in the thread from [this article](https://lih-verma.medium.com/mining-really-long-twitter-messages-threads-569d42bc0e1c)
